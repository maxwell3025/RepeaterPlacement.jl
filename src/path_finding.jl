Extended Dijkstra algorithm to determine the path that minimizes the cost function.

This implementation is based on the extended Dijkstra algorithm as included in the paper
"Concurrent Entanglement Routing for Quantum Networks: Model and Designs" by
Shouqian Shi and Chen Qian.
While the regular Dijkstra algorithm only works for additive cost functions, this one
works for any cost function that is both monotonic (meaning that the cost of path p + e is
greater than the cost of p for any path p and edge e) and isotonic (meaning that if the
cost of p is better than that of p', then the cost of p + e will be better than that of
p' + e).
In the paper it is claimed that the algorithm works for any monotonic cost function, but
this is not true if the cost function is not isotonic.

# Arguments
- `cost_function`: Function that takes a `Path` object and returns two objects:
    1. a `Float64` that represents the cost of the path;
    2. a `Dict{Symbol, Any}` that may contain extra information.
- `graph`: the `SimpleWeightedGraph` through which to find the shortest path.
- `source`: the source node.
- `destination`: the destination node.

# Returns
- `path`: the shortest path from `source` to `destination`, as a `Path` object.
- `cost`: the cost of the path.
- `cache`: a `Dict{Symbol, Any}` that may contain extra information provided by
    `cost_function` for the shortest path.

# Note
The regular Dijkstra algorithm can be obtained by setting the cost function to
`path_length`. It will be less efficient than a dedicated implementation of the regular
Dijkstra algorithm though, as the total length of the path will be recalculated from
scratch each time, instead of by just adding an edge length to the distance to the
previous node.

Find the best path through a graph assuming only monotonicity, not isotoniciy.

Typical path finding algorithms, like (extended) Dijsktra, assume a cost function that is
both monotonic (cost(p + e) > cost(p)) and isotinic (cost(p) > cost(p') implies that
cost(p + e) > cost(p' + e)). This algorithm drops the isotonicity assumption, and as a
consequence it is unable to take some of the shortcuts that are included in e.g. Dijkstra.
Basically the only thing you can do is enumerate all the paths and choose the best one.
This algorithm does exactly that, but it enumerates in a smarter way based on monotonicity.
Each time a subpath is enumerated for which the cost is higher than the current best path,
it is discarded, as all paths based on that subpath are be worse than the current best path.

# Arguments
- `cost_function`: Function that takes a `Path` object and returns two objects:
    1. a `Float64` that represents the cost of the path;
    2. a `Dict{Symbol, Any}` that may contain extra information.
- `graph`: the `SimpleWeightedGraph` through which to find the shortest path.
- `source`: the source node.
- `destination`: the destination node.

# Returns
- `path`: the shortest path from `source` to `destination`, as a `Path` object.
- `cost`: the cost of the path.
- `cache`: a `Dict{Symbol, Any}` that may contain extra information provided by
    `cost_function` for the shortest path.

The order in which paths are enumerated is determined by the `method` keyword argument.
The default is `DepthFirstSearch()`, which extends the longest paths first, hoping to reach
the destination node as soon as possible and allow for early pruning of bad paths.

If an upper bound on the cost of the best path is known a priori, it can be passed as the
`upper_bound` keyword argument. This will allow the algorithm to discard paths early on.
However, if the upper bound is set lower than the actual cost of the best path,
the algorithm will fail to find a path.
In that case, it returns `nothing, nothing`.

An upper bound can also be provided implicitly by providing guesses for good paths.
These should be passed as a vector of `Vector{eltype(graph)}`, where each inner vector is a
different guess represented as a sequence of nodes to be traversed by the path.
For each of the guesses, the cost function is automatically calculated.
Then, the most stringent upper bound provided by the `upper_bound` keyword and these guesses
is used as the real upper bound in path finding.

If the keyword argument `prune_edges` is set to `true`, the graph is pruned before path
finding commences. This means that all edges with a cost higher than the upper bound are
removed from the graph. Moreover, each time the upper bound is updated, the graph is pruned
again. This can result in a significant speedup, but the method assumes that the cost Of
a path consisting of a single edge grows monotonically with the weight of that edge.
This may not be true for every cost function, and hence the default value of `prune_edges`
is `false`.
